Mr E.Vil enters the room.
- "This project is going well!
   The Vice Precident - M.U.Haha is really pleased 
   with the results.

   Next, we have a great market waiting to pay us well,
   if we can give them the ability to replace unwanted
   words by other words.

   For example - assume the following replacements are
   defined

    bad -> ungood    
    better -> gooder 
    objection -> thoughtcrime
    agree -> crimestop

   Thus, the following sentence 

     'Objection is bad, a better thing to do, is to agree.'

   becomes

    'Thoughtcrime is ungood, a gooder thing to do, is to crimestop.'
  
   can you add this functionality?
   "

You get going, but with a nagging feeling that something
bad will come of this in the long run.
