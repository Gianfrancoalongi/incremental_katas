The first delivery went well, and your product owner will join you later today.
Later that day.
Mr E.Vil enters the room.
- "The delivery proved to be solid and now we need to support the ability of
   blacklisting several words.
   It could be a very long list of words"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thus, if nice, pony, sun, light, fun, happy, funny, joy, and others are 
blacklisted words, the sentence 
     "Such a nice day with a bright sun, makes me happy"
becomes
    "Such a XXXX day with a bright XXX, makes me XXXXX"
