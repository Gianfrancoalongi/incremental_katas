Mr E.Vil approaches you.
- "Another solid delivery with the list of blacklisted words.
   All our tests passed and performance looked ok.

   Next, we should be able to match with other competitors out
   in the field. A very popular feature is to replace the whole
   word which the blacklisted word is a prefix of.

   Thus, if we have blacklisted 'friend', the sentence, 
     You are so friendly!
   Would become
     You are so XXXXXXXXX
