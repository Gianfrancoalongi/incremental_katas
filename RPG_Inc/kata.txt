Welcome to RPG Inc! We sell engines for Role Playing Games, and you will join 
the proof of concept and prototyping unit where we try out new ideas and concepts.

We are developing a new small lightweight combat calculation engine that only uses
files for input and output. For the first delivery, we would like the combat 
calculation engine to support the bare minimum, such as calculating each turn in 
the combat and outputting it as well.

For this we start out with some very basic rules.

  1. Each combatant will attack when able
  2. "when able" is defined by the attack speed - minimum is 1
     the attack speed indicates 'every' N:th tick the combatant may attack.
  3. Each combatant has a pre-defined health, when it reaches 0 (zero)
     the combatant is considered dead, and the combat ends.
  4. Each combatant has a weapon, which does a fixed damage per attack

The input file containing the combatants is called combat.rpg and the 
output result of the combat is called result.rpg

One example combat.rpg file can be seen below the line 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'Mark the Fister', 4, 8, 'Iron Fist', 4
'John the Bagger', 1, 7, 'Small Bag', 1

The output result.rpg can be seen below the line
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1,'John The Bagger','Mark The Fister','Small Bag',1,7,7
2,'John The Bagger','Mark The Fister','Small Bag',1,6,7
3,'John The Bagger','Mark The Fister','Small Bag',1,5,7
4,'John The Bagger','Mark The Fister','Small Bag',1,4,7
4,'Mark The Fister','John The Bagger','Iron Fist',4,4,3
5,'John The Bagger','Mark The Fister','Small Bag',1,3,3
6,'John The Bagger','Mark The Fister','Small Bag',1,2,3
7,'John The Bagger','Mark The Fister','Small Bag',1,1,3
8,'John The Bagger','Mark The Fister','Small Bag',1,0,3
8,'Mark The Fister','John The Bagger','Iron Fist',4,0,0
9,'John The Bagger',Dead
9,'Mark The Fister',Dead
TIE

If 'John The Bagger' would have stayed alive, the last line would have been 
'John The Bagger'
If 'Mark The Fister' would have stayed alive, the last line would have been
'Mark The Fister'

Time ticks where nothing happens, are written as 

N,NOTHING

In the result.rpg file, where N is the time tick.
