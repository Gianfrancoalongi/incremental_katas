The new extension was a hit!
As this new engine is gaining in popularity, due to the simplicity and ability
to be interfaced with from any other programming environment.

As we opened up for the high school to request for features, we have now received
several requests, but the one the most schools are requesting is the ability
to equip the fighters with different types of armor.

Our lead developer Ada Love determined that the armor system should be like an 
'extra layer of health' which 'eats up' the damage until the armor is 'broken'.

This to avoid that we change how the weapons work at the moment. She also sent
an example combat.rpg which is shows how the armor is added at the end of the 
combatant information. The armor is 'Leather Jacket' with an armor of 10

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'Bloody Mary', 2, 2, Drinking Glass, (1,3), 'Leather Jacket', 10
'The evil one',1, 5, Magic missile, (1,20)

The example result.rpg which she supplied looks the following
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1,'The evil one','Bloody Mary','Magic Missile',6,(4,2),5
2,'Bloody Mary','The evil one','Drinking Glass',2,(4,2),3
3,'The evil one','Bloody Mary','Magic Missile',4,(0,2),3
4,'Bloody Mary','The evil one','Drinking Glass',3,(0,2),0
4,'The evil one','Bloody Mary','Magic Missile',1,(0,1),0
5,'The evil one',Dead
'Bloody Mary'

Thus, we can see that 'Bloody Mary' seems to have a total of 12 health, divided
into two parts, the first part is the armor, and the second part is the original
health when the combat starts. Even though the initial health is 2, the armor of 
10 gives a total effective health of 12.
