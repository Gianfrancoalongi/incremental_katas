For the next task , you will extend the functionality by replacing the last
integer in the input sequence by the lowest next odd number if not already
odd, when the first number in the input sequence is not even. The mutation of
the last integer happens after all other rules have been applied, with the 
basis of the premise from the pristine unmutated version of the first integer
in the series as it was before any rules where applied to mutate the sequence
of numbers.

As in the examples below

  input: 1,11,10
  output: 1,11,9

  input: 1,11,9
  output: 1,11,9

  input: 12,11,10
  output: 12,11,10
