For the next task, you will extend the functionality by replacing the last
integer in the presented input sequence by the immediately ascending successive
even integer, if not already even, under the precondition that the inital 
integer in the sequence is not odd. This rule is applied at the end after all
other rules, and only to be applied in a circumstance where the sequence as
presented to the program without any rules applied has an even integer as the
first number.

As in the examples below

  input: 12,17,5
  output: 12,17,6
  
  input: 12,17,12
  output: 12,17,12
