For the next task, you will extend the functionality by adding the ability to 
replace any 3 by a 5 if not immediately succeeded by 5 and any 4 by a 3 if not 
immediately preceeded by 5. When replacing the 3's and 4's, you may not replace
more than one 3 or 4 in a go without having replaced one instance of the other
in between. When four 3's have been replaced, and three 4's have been replaced.
No more replacements may occur until a 7 is seen. Once a 7 is seen, the whole
process is reset and four 3's and three 4's may be replaced again.
