For the next task, you will collectively treat any coherent unbroken ascending
sequence of integers, such that the i:th number is one greater than the 
i-1:th number in the sequence, and put them in an inverted order in relation to 
the original order as they where presented. This may only be done for coherent 
and unbroken sequences and no other number may be included if the number does not
fulfills the above mentioned criteria. This rule has to be applied BEFORE any 
other rule is applied.

As in the example below

  input: 12,13,14
  output: 14,13,12

  input: 17,12,13,14,16
  output: 17,14,13,12,16
