Welcome to the Grocery store, we have some pretty nice cash registers which have an
interface to a ROM containing daily sale info, through which we can collect the sales 
reports from all the tills at the end of the day. You see, there is this script which 
connects to the registers and reads the daily transactions, generating a 
Record Of Sales (ROS) which is a file containing an item name, quantity sold of this 
item, and the total price paid for quantity amount of item name.

We collect all of these ROS's and email them for manuall processing by the accountant,
Mr Bean.C.Ounter. However, we will team you up with Mr Bean, so you can facilitate
his job a bit, as we plan to open 30 new Grocery stores.

Your first task is to write a program that reads ROS files and generates the grand
total income for each ROS file.

Thus, the contents of one example ROS file can be found under the dashed line below
