Mr.Bean.Counter approaches you
- "Very good! Now we have a lot of historical data for categories as well, 
   I took this course on Business Intelligence at the University of Bollocks,
   and would like to apply some of this to the data we have! 

   I want your program to be able to calculate the similarity of two ROS files.
   If we can do this, we could let your program tell us how similar stores are  
   by comparings the similarity of their ROS files over time.
  
   If we have the pattern analysis in place, stores with similar ROS files
   could be targeted with similar advertisement campaigns!

- "Ok, so we should be able to pass two files to the program, and it should
   output a number between 0 and 1?"
Mr.Bean.Counter
- "Yes, obviously the same ROS file should be 1 (similar to itself)

   But two files that contain the same 1 item, except for one extra in one
   of the files, can only be 0.5 similar
  
   We consider two items to be equal for now, regardless of sales, as
   long as the same item exists in both ROS.
