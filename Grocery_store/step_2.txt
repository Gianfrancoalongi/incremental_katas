Mr.Bean.Counter approaches you 
- "Great job with the ROS files! You know what, I think we can start collecting 
   more interesting information of these sales if we do some post processing on 
   the ROS files.

   It would be nice if we could categorize the items to be able to spot trends 
   in which type of categories our customers are most interested in.

   I would like you to enrich the ROS files with a new field, containing the
   category, in order to categorize the items, I have supplied you with a list 
   here containing the items and their categories.

   After that you program has categorized the ROS, I would like it to output
   the total amount of money for each category, together with the grand total
   kind of like this

   wheat and pasta: 10
   fruit: 20
   dairy: 40
   meat: 30
   total: 100
  ".
