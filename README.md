incremental_katas
=================

Katas that are delivered incrementally - the full problem is not displayed at once, the next step
of the Kata is revealed when the previous is done (you have to do this yourself by not peeking).

The idea is to simulate business interaction - and the unknown.

It is also the case that not all Katas are 10 steps long, but there might be 10 files.
