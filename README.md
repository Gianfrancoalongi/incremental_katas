incremental_katas
=================

Incremental Katas are katas that change incrementally over time. 
Each one is based on a root kata.txt description, and has 10 possible additions,
each one increment in a file with a numbered name such as step_{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.txt.

You start of by reading kata.txt and completing it (using TDD of course), then go onto step_2.txt,
and when you have finished that, look at step_3.txt, etc.

The idea is to simulate business interaction - and the unknown.

It is also the case that not all Katas are 10 steps long, but there might be 10 files, so, if one
file contains garbage, it is because the kata ends there.

No peeking!
