The Airport Automation project is the first one of its kind where a joint venture
between United Automation and three sensoring equipment vendors attempt to create 
a proof of concept of airport automation. The idea is to automate everything 
except for flight control. 

As soon as the airplanes have touched ground, there is no human intervention,
and the fully automated airport does the rest. The airport keeps track of all 
aiplanes using sophisticated state of the art sensors and fiber optic networks.
This project is worth over 800 billion dollars, and the media attention is worth
double that. If this goes well, airports all over the world will be queueing in
order to buy the Airport Automation System (AAS).

It goes without saying that a failure will be very embarassing and drain our
public relations capital substantially, as well as reflecting negatively on our
partners in this. We will all be doing our best to make this happen!
We heard Agile is good for reacting to change, so we will try this and we want 
you to deliver incrementaly.

For the first delivery, we want the Decision Making Unit (DMU) which communicates 
with all sensoring equipment on the airport. Of course, we will not communicate 
with a whole airport to start with. We will start with a closely monitored terminal, 
Terminal 1.

We need the DMU to receive Airplane Proximity Data (APD), as well as Airplane State 
Data (ASD) from the Gate Sensors (GS), and sending Gate Control Codes (GCC) back to 
the Gate Automation Units (GAU).

              ______
             |DMU   |
             |      |
             |______|
              /  |  \
             /   |   \
        GS:APD   |   GS:ASD
                 |
                GAU  

The DMU needs to accept incoming TCP connection from the APD GS and the ASD GS. 
Once a connection is established, the GS will identify itself by sending an
identification message across the connection which starts with either
'GS:APD-' or 'GS:ASD-' followed by the serial number of the unit.
For example
     GS:APD-12209238A
could be the initial message of the GS which sends APD to the DMU
     GS:ASD-22287242A
could be the initial message of the GS which sends ASD to the DMU.
Upon receiving the identification message, the DMU has to respond with an 'OK-'
followed by the serial number of the unit. Failing to do so, will cause the GS to
resend the identification message within 1 second, until the DMU responds 
appropriately, proving that it has acknowledged the GS.

For example
     OK-12209238A
could be the OK for the APD GS.

After establishing one GS:ASD and one GS:APD connection, the DMU shall connect 
to the GAU on port 50000 and send it's own identification message which starts
with 'DMU:' and the configurable serial number of the DMU.
For example
     DMU:3899829
could be the identification message sent to the GAU.
The GAU will then reply with 'OK-' followed by the serial number of the DMU.
For example
     OK-3899829
could be the OK message sent from the GAU to the DMU which identified itself
as having serial number 3899829. If the DMU does not recieve the OK within 1
second, it will resend the identification message every 2 seconds until the
'handshake' is completed.

APD is a continuous stream of tagged integers, indicating the distance of the 
airplane to the gate - in cm. 
For example
    KYZ77:538
indicates that KYZ77 is 538 centimeters from the gate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASD is a continuous stream of tagged states which indicate if the airplane is 
      NOT_MOVING
      MOVING_AWAY
      MOVING_TOWARDS
      ADJUSTING_POSITION 
relative to the gate.
For example
    KYZ77:MOVING_TOWARDS
indicates that KYZ77 is moving towards the gate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GCC is a tagged octet where the prefix is the GAU identity.
The octets bits are interpreted as follows by the GCU.

    ZZZZZ  WW
    -----  -- 
       ^    ^
       |    |
       |     \ 01 retract the jetway from the airplane
       |       10 extend the jetway towars the airplane
       |       00 do nothing with the jetway  
        \ 
         \ extended instruction set 
           unreserved for future use
  
For example
     GAU123:1
is the code to retract the jetway from the airplane.
Every command is asynchronous, and takes 10 seconds to complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the first delivery, the DMU should be able to continuously receive GS data,
and once it has determined that an airplane has reached the gate, it shall extend
the gate, and 20 minutes later, it shall retract the gate.
