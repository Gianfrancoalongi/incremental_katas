The automatic retraction and extraction of the jetway is working out nicely.
But, there are some things which we can not control, like the weather. 
Sometimes the jetway gets stuck when it's really cold outside. 

In these cases, there is an alarm to manual oversight, and they deice the
jetway joints so that it can move freely again, but first they always put it 
into the retracted position.

In these circumstances, we need a way for the system to know what state the 
jetway is in. We will create a new interface for all manual intervention state
changes. The interface is called A2.

              ______
             |DMU   |----A1
             |      |----A2
             |______|----GS:GPD
              /  |  \
             /   |   \
        GS:APD   |   GS:ASD
                 |
                GAU  


The A2 interface is a passive one like the A1 interface. It receives a connection
on the port 50002, and a message. We will start with receiving the 'reset'
message from the GAU the DMU is connected to. Indicating that the jetway has been
reset to a retracted state, regardless of what was ongoing.

The GAU will connect across A2 and send 
    RESET
the connection will then be closed.

Upon receiving RESET, we will know that the jetway got stuck and a manual reset
had to be done. 

The third delivery has make the DMU able to deal with this.
Make sure you speak to the manual oversight crew and let them help us in 
designing the test cases.
