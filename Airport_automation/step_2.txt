Initial tests with Terminal 1 shows that the DMU works well, and we can safely 
allow for more parts of the system to be controlled in this manner. 
In order to fully automate the jetwalk, we have added a new GS which sends Gate 
Passing Data (GPD) used to monitor movements through the airplane entrance.

We will also have a new interface which receives the debarking passenger amount
from the arriving airplanes.o It is called the A1 interface. The data received on 
A1 is used by the DMU to decide the appropriate GCCs.

              ______
             |DMU   |----A1
             |      |----GS:GPD
             |______|
              /  |  \
             /   |   \
        GS:APD   |   GS:ASD
                 |
                GAU  


For this delivery, the goal is to make the jetway extension/retraction fully 
automated so that we don't rely on a 20 minute interval to retract the jetway 
once we have extended it.

Every airplane which is on it's way to the gate will send a message starting 
with the airplane designation and the amount of passengers which will debark at
the gate.
For example
     KYZ77:84
could be the message indicating that the airplane KYZ77 has 84 people onboard
that will debark once the jetway has connected to the airplane.
The A1 interface is a tcp connection established from the airplane, towards
the DMU at port 50001. Once the airplane has sent the message, the connection
is to be closed.

The GS:GPD identifies in the similar manner as the GS:ASD/APD's, by connecting
to the DMU and sending an identification message, expecting the OK with the
serial number.
For example
     GS:GPD-833822A
could be the initial message of the GS which sends GPD to the DMU.
Upon receiving the identification message, the DMU has to respond with an 'OK-'
followed by the serial number of the unit. 
For example
    OK-833822A
could be the OK for the GS:GPD initial handshake.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GPD is a tagged 1 sent for to the DMU for every passenger that is identified as 
passing the gate to which the GS:GPD is connected. The tag is the airplane 
which the passenger is leaving.
For example
    KYZ77:1
indicates that the GPD has noticed that one passenger has left KYZ77 through the
gate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The DMU must wait for all three GS:APD/ASD/GPD to connect before establishing a 
connection to the GAU.
