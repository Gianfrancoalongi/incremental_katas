During lunch break, the newsfeed cut in, and a 'Breaking News!' message comes on.

-"Last night, Mars Mining Inc lost a deal worth an estimated 900 billion credits,
  and might also have worsened the diplomatic tension between the Empire of Man 
  and the Technoids.
 
  CEO John McDrill has refused to answer questions, but ensures everyone that 
  Mars Mining Inc. do not have any hostile intensions, and that we will take 
  more steps to ensure that no unintentional threats are perceived by the  
  Technoids.
  
  John McDrill says 'ILAB licensed their product to us, ensuring that it would 
  safeguard the communication with the Technoids. Apparently it does not.
  ."

The news anchor adjusts her papers and the news feed ends.

- "We will have to pay Mars Mining Inc some credits to keep them as our
   customer, and step up our game to gain their trust again."

Your CEO storms out of the lunch room.

What has happened is that the Technoids aparently also scan messages for diagonal
words. The CEO of the company has hired a Technoid expert to help the team cover
all possible corners and Technoid scan sequences.

According to the expert, Technoids scan messages

  1. Vertically
  2. Horizontally.
  3. Diagonally downards to the left.

You need to ensure that no bad words occur due to unfortunate alignments 
in scans of 1 and 3. If bad words occur, you need to correct this by 
changing alignment as in the previous release.
