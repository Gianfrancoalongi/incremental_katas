- "The decree 451 feature was a total hit!
   Basically everyone wants to use our system now, out of pure fear of being 
   convicted and sent to a slave colony.
   This has been enabled in all our adjustment products, and not only the 
   business/diplomat suite."

As the adjustment system is increasingly popular, more traders and diplomats are
using it, and this has introduced a slightly interesting problem for your company.

The Technoids are a sentient species composed of non-organic beings such as 
autonomous vacuum cleaners, military killer robots and intricate voice mail systems.
They left earth roughly 52 years ago and have been keeping to themselves, until now.

Given their mechanical nature, they are big fans of pattern matching, search algorithms
and general calculations of any sort. This has now posed a problem!

Just last week, one of the traders working for a mining company on Mars, sent 
a message which the Technoids apparently took for containing a hidden message.
And they where not happy! 

The offensive message in question can be seen below.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FROM:Mars Mining Inc.
TO:Technoid colony
SIGNED:John Paulgood, sales department Mars Minin Inc.
Dear Technoids. We are a mining company active
in the deep caves of Mars. Recent discoveries of
effirium (a very hard to produce metal alloy) has brought me to contact you!

The offensive message is the "Die" which can be found if you scan downwards
along the leftmost column in the text.

Technoids can not be reasoned with, if they find something - it is taken for 
truth, no matter how improbable it was to find this something.

We want to extend our functionality so that we perform similar scans on messages,
and rearrange text slightly, so as to avoid any such unfortunate improbable
alignments. Rearrange by breaking the sentence earlier or later.

Ensure no 'offensive' words or threats can be found in the text when scanning
vertically along any column.
