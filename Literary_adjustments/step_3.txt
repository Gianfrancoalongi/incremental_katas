This just in!

In this year of 2244, by decree number 451 from the Royal Academy of 
Cultural Correctness and Morality, it is not natural and a pure act of defiance 
against proper form when two lines of text next to each other start with the 
same two or more words.

This is considered a direct violation against the very basic beliefs upon which
our Human Empire is built, and has corruptive capabilities, damaging the minds
of our young.

Please, be a good citizen and report any such violations to your local 
Correctness and Morality officers.

- "Wow, did you get that?"

- "Yeah, we should probably sell this as a service, guaranteeing that messages
   passing our system follows decree 451, this way, our clients can just
   send their messages and feel safe."

- "I will just send a message to the Royal Academy of Cultural Correctness and Moral,
   to ask if it is enough to just change the syntax of the line, by inserting 
   an additional space before the next line to make them read different.

 .... 2 hours later ....

- "Bad luck, it is not sufficient.
   But, it would be sufficient to just add anything in front of it.
   We could add (ignore this) and just pass it on.
   What do you think?"

- "I don't know, this would happen to millions of messages every second, whatever
   we choose, it should be lightweight and not too intrusive, not to mention
   that it has to be language neutral."

Whatever you choose to implement, the important thing to understand, is that
the following lines of text are currently in direct violation of decree 451.

"He sent the message to me this morning. Once Alex came in to the office, he told me that
 he sent the message at 06.00 and not 08.00, as I requested."
