The interplanetary literary adjustment bureau (ILAB) is the number one text
adjusting agency that handles spelling corrections, grammatical corrections and
semantically preserving colloquial expression translation. Over 183 million texts
per second are adjusted daily in between communicating parties in the whole of 
the Human Empire.

We are launching a new service which not only corrects simple mistakes, but also 
handles layout and other visually appealing factors. This service is aimed at
diplomatic communication and thus has some very special requirements regarding
localization.

The idea is that the diplomats and other negotiating personnel will be able to
input the text as is, and we format it nicely, adjusting any colloquialisms,
and cosmetic errors, producing an appealing result without them having to focus
on anything else but their business.

Diplomatic communication follows the ISO-83923:2242 standard where the message 
always has the three non-optional FROM/TO/SIGNED headers. After this, the 
immediate text that follows is the message.

Thus, an example message from The United European Trades Union of Earth to the 
23rd Mars colony could look like this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FROM:The United European Trades Union of Earth
TO:23rd Mars colony
SIGNED:President of the Chamber Of Trades
Greetings.
Would you be interested in trading Plutonium with us?
...
Best regards
 President of Trades

For the first delivery we will deliver the functionality to ensure that all 
messages that get processed get the headers rearranged so that the order is 
guaranteed to be FROM, TO, SIGNED. 

Thus, the following example message would all get the headers rearranged
so that FROM is the first line, TO is the second line, and SIGNED is the third
line.

SIGNED:1st Colony Manager
TO:President of Earth
FROM:1st Human Colony on Venus
