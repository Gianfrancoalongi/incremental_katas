As more companies and diplomatic ties start to form between the Empire of Man,
and the Technoids - your company receives the Most Magnificent Morality Medal 
for great service towards mankind and peace.

However, there are problems related to the rearrangement of text which was
introduced in the previous releases.

Embassies and the Legal sector are avid users of printed text, and tend to print
all received communication on 215,9mm by 355,6 mm paper. When printing, they 
use large fonts, to ensure that no one misreads the message. As a consequence 
of this, they never write any line that spans more than 75 characters. 

This untold rule, is something that has been observed to be broken, due to our
program restructuring the text.

For our next release, we have to correct this, and ensure that no line of text
is more than 75 characters wide. While still delivering the same feature
capability as before. If the user wrote lines that are more than 75 characters
wide, we will always ensure that all lines are a maximum of 75 characters wide.
