High Brass storms into the room:
  God damn it!
  How could you NOT have added the ability to play more than one round?
  The Otakus in Japan are all complaining that the game is reset after each run!
  THE GAME IS WORTHLESS!
  HOW COULD YOU NOT ADD THIS SIMPLE THING!

Team lead: Oh, wow, well, this has always been a POC, a bare minimum skeleton,
  and we thought we would be told when it's not a POC any more. 
  Actually, let's take the discussion outside.

*High brass and team lead take the conversation outside*

Team lead: Ok, team, we'll make the following simple change.
 If there is a file called last_state.txt, it is the start position for the current
 N_commands.txt files, and it there is no such file, it is generated, containing
 the last state of the states.txt

This keeps state between each invocation of the program.
Let's do this!
