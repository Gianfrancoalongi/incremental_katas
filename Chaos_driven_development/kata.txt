Hi there, welcome to the Chaos Driven Development team!

We are developing a digital port of a board game where you program robots, and 
our first delivery is a proof of concept to show the high brass a minimal
POC they can play with.

As we have some sla...interns doing some overti....long days, we can use them to 
do graphics development for any device. We will just give them a game state 
representation through a text file, and then they will visualize it for us.

The bare bones of the POC is simple. 

1. One robot, that is heading in one of the four cardinal directions, East, West, 
   North or South. 

2. The robot reacts to commands, which are given in sequence. 
   The commands are
   
    DF - Drive Forward 1 Step
    DB - Drive Backward 1 Step
    TL - Turn Left 90 degrees
    TR - Turn Right 90 degrees

3. For every command the robot reacts to, the game is put into a new game state.

The input to our program is a text file called commands.txt 
One such example file can be seen below
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DF
TR
DB
TL
DB

The output file called states.txt would then contain 6 visualizations of the 
game state, the initial state + all 5 resulting states from the commands.
If we assume the game board is 4 x 4, and the robot starts in the lower right
corner, facing North - the example states.txt file would be
