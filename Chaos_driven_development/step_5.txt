Last week was epic!
But, you know what, my weekend was even more epic!
I went to see Transmorphers at a friends home, and we combined it with a drinking
game. You put a moustache on the screen, and every time someone is 'wearing' the 
moustache, you drink. So, one moustache per person playing, it was a necessary
thing to help that movie.

Anyway. 
The visualizations are great, and we are ready to add on some more stuff.
What we want now, is board elements. For this sprint, we'll work on Walls and
Pits.

1. Walls are immovable object on the playfield, randomly placed, which can not 
   be moved. But, they are not allowed to be placed on the start-row of the
   robots.
   A robot can not drive through a wall.
   We choose whatever way we wish to represent the walls.

2. Pits are black holes which a robot can drive into if it is not carefully
   programmed.
   If the robot drives into the pit, it is "dead" and can not take any more 
   actions. It will not respond to commands and can not play.
