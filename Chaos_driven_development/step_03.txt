Had a good lunch?
Sorry that I had to run like that, but the high brass was calling from Tokyo, 
I think it's like 3 am over there - and apparently they are striking some nice
deals with some Otakus who are willing to beta test this for us, and pay good
money while doing so.

It was a bit hard to understand exactly what they wanted, but I think that if we
deliver this quickly (but still tested, verified and according to our principles), 
with the following changes, we are in for some big bonuses!

1. You do not write the commands.txt your self any more. 
   This file is now generated by the program when executed without any input.
   You will then reorder the commands in any order you wish.
   You may also delete commands, but you have to supply at least 5 commands
   to the program when executing it with the modified commands.txt file.

2. The generated commands.txt file contains 9 commands, drawn at random from a set 
   of base commands, consisting of 
 
    18 | DF 1
    12 | DF 2
     6 | DF 3
     6 | DB
    18 | TR
    18 | TL
     6 | UT

   Thus, there are 84 possible commands, and 9 are drawn at random, and given to 
   the player.

3. The inital game state is always that the robot starts in the lower right 
   corner, on a 12 x 12 board.
